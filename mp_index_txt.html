Welcome

  Mobile Panini nis the culmination of the dream of
  Antonio and Carmen Dolcini, who came to America 
  looking to serve people the authentic recipes learned 
  from their Sicilian family.

Antonio began work as a child in his grandmother's 
deli where he learned the age-old secrets of Sicilian 
cooking. He refined his technique at the Culinary Institute 
of Milan. His younger brother, Carmen, with no less of a love for 
cooking and good food, also worked in the deli and became 
well-acquainted with the open-air fresh food markets of his 
home town. Carmen too, is a proud graduate of the Culinary Institute of Milan.

Now you can enjoy what they have learned and mastered,
right outside your door; but with no compromises in freshness 
or delicacy of preparation. We've partnered with Curbside Thai to
bring you the finest cuisine on four wheels - from the East and the West!
